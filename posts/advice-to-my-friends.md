I always have friends asking me what my advice is to land internships for the summer and I always give them a few helpful tips but I never really get time to tell them everything. So I am writing this post to centralize my thoughts so that I can share everything in one go.

So here are my (extremely disorganized) set of tips to anyone looking for an internship!

## Apply Early

Not like December early, or October early. I mean start looking during the summer itself. Ideally you should be looking for your next internship while at your current one (if you have one).  Now this doesn't mean you should be disrespectful and look at job postings while you're at work, but the general point is that you should be looking in July or August.

You honestly wont find my posts BUT these are generally the posts where recruiters will actually look at your resume. Once it gets to December, they will have thousands of resume's and will just give up. However, you shouldn't stop applying after September, but chances do start decreasing after that (except for big companies).

## Apply to Companies that DON'T post on LinkedIn/GlassDoor

If you are like everyone else, you'll probably be scouring LinkedIn, GlassDoor, and all of these other job marketplaces. While thats fine, you have thousands of other students doing the same thing. Instead think of some companies that are sort of niche but you would like to work at, and try to apply or email that company. Most people ignore this but it really does work; my upcoming internship was not on any job forums (as far as I know), so the applicant pool was much much smaller.

## Interview Advice

I have a lot of advice for both technical interviews and "phone screens" or whatever else they call non-technical interviews. This is pretty much your last step before you get an offer BUT messing up at any of these will ruin your chances. I'd highly recommend following some of the tips below since they seemed to have worked for me.

I'll continually update this post with more advice as I think of it or gain more experience or inside information. I really hope that this helped you in some way and if you have any suggestions, feel free to email me!
