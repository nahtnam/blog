I always have friends asking me what my advice is to land internships for the summer and I always give them a few helpful tips but I never really get time to tell them everything. So I am writing this post to centralize my thoughts so that I can share everything in one go.

So here are my (extremely disorganized) set of tips to anyone looking for an internship!

## Apply Early

Not like December early, or October early. I mean start looking during the summer itself. Ideally you should be looking for your next internship while at your current one (if you have one).  Now this doesn't mean you should be disrespectful and look at job postings while you're at work, but the general point is that you should be looking in July or August.

You honestly wont find my posts BUT these are generally the posts where recruiters will actually look at your resume. Once it gets to December, they will have thousands of resume's and will just give up. However, you shouldn't stop applying after September, but chances do start decreasing after that (except for big companies).

## Apply to Companies that DON'T post on LinkedIn/GlassDoor

If you are like everyone else, you'll probably be scouring LinkedIn, GlassDoor, and all of these other job marketplaces. While thats fine, you have thousands of other students doing the same thing. Instead think of some companies that are sort of niche but you would like to work at, and try to apply or email that company. Most people ignore this but it really does work; my upcoming internship was not on any job forums (as far as I know), so the applicant pool was much much smaller.

## Coding Tests

The first step towards landing your internship is usually a coding test. These vary in difficulty from a simple parenthesis question to an extremely complex math and recursive function. You should do the usual HackerRank and LeetCode stuff. The only way to really get good at these are to do a lot of them.

However I do have on trick to coming up with solutions to a lot of coding challenges. The trick is to do the program by hand on paper first. Chances are your brain will come up with an efficient algorithm to solve it off the bat. For example, there is a security guards problem where you have a grid that contains guards who can look up, down, left, and right but not diagonally. You are given a point on the grid and you have to say whether or not that block is hidden from the guards as efficiently as possible. Now you can do this with just some for loops stacked inside of each other, but there is a more optimal solution. I was able to find something that was pretty efficient by just drawing the grid on paper, filling in the guard position with one of the test cases they gave, and tried to figure out if the spot was safe by hand. Whatever strategy my brain came up with was more efficient than just doing the naive solution. Try it yourself, I'm sure you will figure it out quickly. Now this is a really really simple problem but this trick really does work on some of the most complex questions I have gotten in the past.

**Even if you complete the test and ace all of the test cases, you still have a 75% chance of not even hearing back.** That's just how it is, so don't be discouraged if you don't hear back. However, it doesn't hurt to follow up with your recruiter once or twice at max.

## Interview Advice

I have a lot of advice for both technical interviews and "phone screens" or whatever else they call non-technical interviews. This is pretty much your last step before you get an offer BUT messing up at any of these will ruin your chances. I'd highly recommend following some of the tips below since they seemed to have worked for me.

I'll continually update this post with more advice as I think of it or gain more experience or inside information. I really hope that this helped you in some way and if you have any suggestions, feel free to email me!
